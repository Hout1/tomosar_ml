# Machine Learning for TomoSAR - Development Branch

### keywords: TomoSAR, machine learning, feature engineering, feature selection

## Overview

The idea of this project is to compare the performance of different machine 
learning algorithms on tomographic SAR data. To reduce the dimensionality of the
and ultimately to increase computational time and get rid of any noise - 
the tomogram is represented by a number of descriptive features. Finally, the 
performance (computational time and classification accuracy) of the selected 
machine learning algorithms on the different feature representations of the data 
should be compared with the performance on the original data (Tomogram).
